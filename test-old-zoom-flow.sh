echo "  - meeting/create: Used by old flow with requireToken: true"
echo "  - meeting/signature: Used by old flow with requireToken: true"

echo "3. Differences found between old and new flow:"
echo "  OLD: requireToken: true"
echo "  NEW: requireToken: false"
echo "  OLD: Single component handles entire lifecycle"
echo "  NEW: Multiple components with navigation state passing"

echo "4. Key success factors of old flow:"
echo "  ✅ Immediate signature fetch after meeting creation"
echo "  ✅ Same component manages entire state"
echo "  ✅ No navigation state dependencies"
echo "  ✅ Synchronous error handling"

echo "5. Potential issues with new flow:"
echo "  ❌ Token configuration mismatch (requireToken: false vs true)"
echo "  ❌ State passing through navigation"
echo "  ❌ Multiple component lifecycle coordination"
echo "  ❌ Async error handling across components"

echo "RECOMMENDATION: Test both flows side by side to identify the exact breaking point."
